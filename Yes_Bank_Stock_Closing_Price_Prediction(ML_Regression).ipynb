Candlestick charts are commonly used in financial analysis to visualize the movement of stock prices over time. Each candlestick represents the open, high, low, and close prices for a specific period (e.g., day, week, month), providing valuable insights into price trends, volatility, and market sentiment.\n",

        "\n",

        "4. **Visual Appeal:** Candlestick charts are visually appealing and can effectively communicate complex price dynamics to stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given that the goal is to describe price movements in the dataset, the Candlestick chart is a suitable choice due to its ability to provide a detailed and insightful representation of stock price data."
